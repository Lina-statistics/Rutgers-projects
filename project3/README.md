Topic:  Analyzing Survey Data with Categorical Variables.

Application: Survey of Wine preferences in SB and HK


In June 2005, a wine knowledge survey was conducted by Synovate to investigate differences in the wine education market between Shanghai and Beijing(referred to as SB) and Hong Kong (referred to as HK). The responses from decision makers (typically owners or managers) and implementers (typically staff such as waiters) were tallied separately. We play the role of analysts working for a company that conducts enology (the study of wine) classes and wine education in general. We wish to identify the optimal market to expand into and maximize our return on investment by opening some school in the best possible market for the best possible audience. Additionally, we wish to identify sub-markets, i.e. target audiences, on whom we should concentrate in order to maximize our profitability. This survey was conducted in the summer of 2005 and was directed to decision makers and	Implementers of the wine business in the respective cities. The broad objective of this project is to try to understand more about the wine markets of Hong Kong and China, to understand the differences and similarities overall and between decision makers and implementers.  The outcome of this study was used to  create MWM wine schools https://mwminternational.com

Questions:

1.	Differences between HK and SB in knowledge about wine?, In education? Interest in wine courses?, what kid of courses?, willing to pay? etc.

2.	What kind of courses should I open? Where? What revenue should I expect?
