Dataset: dataset 1.13 in the text book. Data gathered from 3,470 annual personal interviews conducted for the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY, 1995) from 1979 through 1986.

Primary question: Does breast feeding protect the infant against hospitalized pneumonia in their first year? 

Secondary question: Compared with breast feeding choice, can other factors have effect on the months for hospitalization, including age of mother, urban environment, alcohol use by mother during pregnancy, cigarette use by mother, region of the country, mother at poverty level, normal birthweight, race of mother, education of mother, number of siblings and month the child on solid food

Material and method:
Both nonparametric and semiparametric analysis will be performed. The former one will be used to compare the infant survival curves and evaluate all factors potentially related with infant hospitalized pneumonia. The latter one will be used to evaluate and compare different factors on the protection of infants against hospitalized pneumonia with breast feeding.

Perspective: After a comprehensive study of all potential factors, we hope the results can help us design a general guideline to lower infant hospitalized pneumonia incidence.
